# Doodle Jump Recreation

I created this game as a final project for my introductory Computer Science Class, 15-112. It showcases many of the skills that I learned throughout the class, including basic loops, animations, data structures, recursion, and backtracking. The files are separated into folders, where we had to meet each checkpoint tp0, tp1, tp2, and tp3 (final). You can see my progress as I went further with the code, and as I gained a deeper understanding of how to create a better game. 

I believe the folder of most interest is the tp3 folder. This is the final result that I turned in, along with a writeup of my ideas and how I approached the various challenges as I programmed on my own. 

## Note

Unfortunately, this project was created in Fall 2022, so the function names called for TkInter are mostly deprecated and the game no longer runs.
