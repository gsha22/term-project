# Doodle Jump Recreation

I created this game as a final project for my introductory Computer Science Class, 15-112. It showcases many of the skills that I learned throughout the class, including basic loops, animations, data structures, recursion, and backtracking. The files are separated into folders, where we had to meet each checkpoint tp0, tp1, tp2, and tp3 (final). You can see my progress as I went further with the code, and as I gained a deeper understanding of how to create a better game. 

## To Play

To play the game, go to the tp3 file. Then run the main file after downloading the required packages. Read my readme.txt file within the tp3 file to see some tips that help gameplay.
