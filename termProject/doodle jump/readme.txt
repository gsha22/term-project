This game is called 112 Jump, and it is based on the famous mobile game Doodle
Jump. It is very similar to the real game because it is a vertical jumper that
utilizes physics and player movement to reach the highest possible height. The 
player can use the "a" and "d" key to move left and right respectively, and the 
Space bar to shoot enemies. The goal is to just jump as high as you can! Once 
you finish, you can enter your name and see if you're on the top 10 leaderboard!

To run the game, use the ctrl+b shortcut in the file "main.py." No need to set 
any extra things up! 

For this game, I had to install Pillow for the imaging library, and Pygame for 
the sound effects. 

There aren't any shortcut commands in this game, only the buttons on the screen.
