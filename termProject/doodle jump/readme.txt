This game is called 112 Jump, and it is based on the famous mobile game Doodle
Jump. It is very similar to the real game because it is a vertical jumper that
utilizes physics and player movement to reach the highest possible height. Once 
you finish, you can enter your name and see if you're on the top 10 leaderboard!

Controls:
    "a" to move left
    "d" to move right
    "Space bar" to shoot

Set Up:

To run the game, use the ctrl+b shortcut in the file "main.py." 

To get the best gameplay, you'll have to change some settings on your computer 
to have the best sideways movement. Don't worry though, it isn't anything 
drastic. This is needed because Keypressed spams the key pressed and will freeze
the program if we don't change some settings beforehand. 


For windows:
> type in "Keyboard" into the bottom left search. Then put "Repeat delay" all 
  the way to Long, and then put "Repeat rate" all the way to slow. 

For macOS:
> Choose the apple menu then go to system settings, then click Keyboard. 
Drag the "Delay until repeat" to the longest possible, and then draw the "Key
repeat rate" to as slow as possible as well. 


For this game, I had to install Pillow for the imaging library, and Pygame for 
the sound effects. 

There aren't any shortcut commands in this game, only the buttons on the screen.
